  ðŸ”¼ Scale Up Behavior Explained

| Line                             | Meaning                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `stabilizationWindowSeconds: 30` | **Wait 30 seconds** before scaling up again, to avoid reacting too quickly to short spikes in usage.                           |
| `type: Pods` + `value: 2`        | **At most 2 pods** can be added every 30 seconds.                                                                              |
| `selectPolicy: Max`              | If there are multiple policies, **choose the one that allows more pods** to be added. (In this case, thereâ€™s only one policy.) |

âœ… Example:
Letâ€™s say:

Your deployment has 1 pod running.

Suddenly, CPU usage goes very high and HPA decides it needs 5 pods.

Hereâ€™s what happens:

Initial scale-up: 1 âžœ 3 pods (added 2 pods as per policy)

Wait 30 seconds

If high usage continues: 3 âžœ 5 pods (adds 2 more pods)

ðŸ“Œ It will not add all 4 pods at once, even if needed. It limits the scaling to 2 pods per 30 seconds.

This avoids overloading your cluster and gives time to observe if the CPU spike is real or temporary.

ðŸ”½ Scale Down Behavior (Easy Explanation)

| Line                             | Meaning                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60` | **Wait 60 seconds** before scaling down again, to avoid reacting too quickly to small drops in usage. |
| `type: Percent` + `value: 50`    | In one go, **you can reduce up to 50%** of the current pods.                                          |
| `type: Pods` + `value: 1`        | Or, **you can remove 1 pod** at a time.                                                               |
| `selectPolicy: Max`              | Between 50% and 1 pod, **choose the option that removes more pods**.                                  |


âœ… Example:
If you have 4 pods running:

50% of 4 = 2 pods

1 pod = 1

Since selectPolicy: Max, it chooses 2 pods to remove.

This setup gives you control and safety when scaling down â€” it won't suddenly remove too many pods or respond too fast to a temporary drop.
