# ‚úÖ Example Scenario

Assume:

Current Pods: 4

CPU usage: High (scale up) or Low (scale down)

| Time  | Event              | Scale Up Action                   | Scale Down Action                                    |
| ----- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00 | High CPU detected  | Add **2 pods** ‚Üí total **6**      | ‚Äî                                                    |
| 00:30 | High CPU continues | Add **2 more pods** ‚Üí total **8** | ‚Äî                                                    |
| 01:00 | CPU drops          | ‚Äî                                 | Remove **2 pods** (50% of 4) ‚Üí total **2**           |
| 02:00 | Still low usage    | ‚Äî                                 | Remove **1 pod** (Max is 1 pod or 50%) ‚Üí total **1** |

 üìå Summary
Scale Up is cautious: adds 2 pods max every 30 sec.

Scale Down is safer: removes either 50% or 1 pod max every 60 sec ‚Äî whichever is more.

This approach helps avoid both over-scaling and under-scaling your app quickly.
