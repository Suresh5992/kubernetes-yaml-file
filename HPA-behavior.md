üîÅ HPA Scale Behavior: Scale Up vs Scale Down


| Feature                       | Scale Up                                | Scale Down                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Wait Time**                | 30 seconds                              | 60 seconds                                  |
| **Policy 1**                 | Add up to **2 pods** every 30 seconds   | Remove up to **50%** of pods every 60 sec   |
| **Policy 2**                 | *(Only one policy defined)*             | Remove up to **1 pod** every 60 seconds     |
| **selectPolicy**             | `Max` ‚Üí add more pods                   | `Max` ‚Üí remove more pods (50% or 1 pod)     |

| Time   | Event             | Scale Up Action                          | Scale Down Action                         |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 00:00  | High CPU detected | Add 2 pods ‚Üí total 6                     | ‚Äî                                         |
| 00:30  | High CPU continues| Add 2 more pods ‚Üí total 8                | ‚Äî                                         |
| 01:00  | CPU drops         | ‚Äî                                        | Remove 2 pods (50% of 4) ‚Üí total 2        |
| 02:00  | Still low usage   | ‚Äî                                        | Remove 1 pod ‚Üí total 1                    |





üîΩ Scale Down Behavior (Easy Explanation)


If you have 4 pods running:

50% of 4 = 2 pods

1 pod = 1

Since selectPolicy: Max, it chooses 2 pods to remove.

This setup gives you control and safety when scaling down ‚Äî it won't suddenly remove too many pods or respond too fast to a temporary drop.




üîº Scale Up Behavior Explained
‚úÖ Example:
Let‚Äôs say:

Your deployment has 1 pod running.

Suddenly, CPU usage goes very high and HPA decides it needs 5 pods.

Here‚Äôs what happens:

Initial scale-up: 1 ‚ûú 3 pods (added 2 pods as per policy)

Wait 30 seconds

If high usage continues: 3 ‚ûú 5 pods (adds 2 more pods)

üìå It will not add all 4 pods at once, even if needed. It limits the scaling to 2 pods per 30 seconds.

This avoids overloading your cluster and gives time to observe if the CPU spike is real or temporary.
